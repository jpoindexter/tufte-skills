description: "Use when invoked by name (/tufte in Claude Code, $tufte in Codex, or 'tufte' in any agent), or when creating, reviewing, or auditing any data display — chart, graph, table, dashboard, map, timeline, sparkline, diagram, annotated image, slide deck, or evidence presentation — and it's unclear which tufte-* skill applies. Router for the 30-skill Edward Tufte pack."

# Tufte Router

Front door to the 30-skill Edward Tufte pack. Route the task to the smallest set of sibling skills, load them, apply them to the work at hand. Do not return a catalog or a description of the pack — use it.

## Loading sibling skills — works in any agent

Every sibling skill is installed beside this one, in the same skills directory: `../<slug>/SKILL.md` relative to this file (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/tufte-sparklines/SKILL.md`, `~/.codex/skills/tufte-sparklines/SKILL.md`).

- **Claude Code:** invoke the sibling by slug with the Skill tool.
- **Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, opencode, or any other agent:** read the sibling's `SKILL.md` with your file-read tool, then follow it. Reading the file IS loading the skill — no special tool required.
- **Single-file fallback:** if the siblings are not installed, read `CANON.md` in this folder — the complete pack condensed into one document. Use it whenever loading multiple siblings is impractical in your runtime.

## Route

1. Treat any arguments after the invocation as the task. No arguments → use the active task.
2. Select 1–4 skills from the routing table. Load them, apply them, and name which you used in one line.
3. About to ship a display? Run the Master Audit below and load the matching skill for any point that fails.

## Routing table

| Task signal | Load |
|---|---|
| New chart or graphic from scratch; choosing graphic vs table vs sentence | `tufte-graphical-excellence` |
| Axis scaling, truncated baseline, "is this misleading", pictogram sizing | `tufte-graphical-integrity` |
| Decluttering, "too busy", gridlines, fills, frames | `tufte-data-ink-ratio` + `tufte-chartjunk` |
| Visual noise, figure/ground, layer weights, boxed labels | `tufte-layering-and-separation` |
| Many series or conditions to compare; faceting; trellis | `tufte-small-multiples` |
| "How much data can this hold", sparse-vs-dense calls | `tufte-data-density` |
| Inline trends, KPI rows, word-sized graphics, table cells with history | `tufte-sparklines` |
| Choosing or reviewing color | `tufte-color-in-information-design` + `tufte-redundant-encoding` |
| Geographic or spatial data | `tufte-data-maps` + `tufte-micro-macro-readings` |
| Schedules, timetables, movement over time | `tufte-space-time-graphics` |
| Causal claims, A/B results, "did X cause Y", pre/post charts | `tufte-causal-reasoning-in-graphics` + `tufte-evidence-corruption` |
| Slide decks, report vs presentation, bullet hierarchies | `tufte-cognitive-style` + `tufte-analytical-design` |
| Diagrams with arrows or connectors; architecture diagrams | `tufte-link-differentiation` |
| Annotating images, screenshots, photos as evidence | `tufte-mapped-pictures` |
| Before/after, side-by-side, overlay comparisons | `tufte-parallelism` |
| Multi-image argument, poster, explainer composition | `tufte-visual-confections` |
| Labels, legends, table typography, linebreaks in data | `tufte-typography-for-data` |
| Multivariate data on a flat screen; >2 variables | `tufte-escaping-flatland` + `tufte-multifunctioning-elements` |
| Reports/docs where figures, tables, and text are segregated; "see Figure 3" | `tufte-integration-of-modes` |
| Annotating evidence, commentary layers, explaining a display in place | `tufte-annotation-as-thinking` |
| UI copy, wayfinding, help text, labels at the point of action | `tufte-instructions-at-point-of-need` |
| Step-by-step narrative, instructional sequence, motion in stills | `tufte-narrative-and-sequence` |
| Evidence quality, cherry-picking, model-searching, integrity of analysis | `tufte-evidence-corruption` + `tufte-visual-thinking` |
| Aesthetic polish, proportion, line weight, friendliness | `tufte-aesthetics-and-technique` |

## Master Audit — run before shipping any data display

Each point names the skill to load for depth on a failure.

1. **Format** — does this deserve a graphic at all (vs sentence/table)? Right form chosen? → `tufte-graphical-excellence`
2. **Truth** — Lie Factor ≈ 1.0; visual dims ≤ data dims; context answers "compared with what?" → `tufte-graphical-integrity`
3. **Ink** — two-pass erasure done; grid gray or gone; no fills/3-D/shadows → `tufte-data-ink-ratio`
4. **Chartjunk** — no moiré fills, dark grids, or ducks → `tufte-chartjunk`
5. **Density** — data matrix as large as the question warrants; shrinkable by half? → `tufte-data-density`
6. **Multivariate** — variables shown vs variables the phenomenon has → `tufte-escaping-flatland`
7. **Comparison** — everything compared in one eyespan, like against like, causal variable on the axis → `tufte-small-multiples`, `tufte-causal-reasoning-in-graphics`
8. **Layering** — weight ∝ importance; 1+1=3 effects hunted; nothing boxed → `tufte-layering-and-separation`
9. **Color** — role named (label/measure/represent/decorate); no red/green solo → `tufte-color-in-information-design`
10. **Type** — direct labels, no legend; horizontal; tabular figures → `tufte-typography-for-data`
11. **Documentation** — author, sources, scales, units, date on the display itself → `tufte-analytical-design`
12. **Integrity** — data traceable; no cherry-picked baselines, bins, or models; headline = actual finding → `tufte-evidence-corruption`

## Guardrails

- Load 1–4 siblings, not the whole pack; `CANON.md` covers the everything-at-once case.
- Routing must end in application to the current task, not a summary of what the skills say.
- Chart *selection and encoding* mechanics (which chart type, perceptual channel ranking) live outside this pack — pair with a data-visualization skill if installed.
